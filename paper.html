<h3>A PROPOSED DEFINITION</h3>
<p>Computers are special technology and they raise some special ethical issues.
  In this essay I will discuss what makes computers different from other
  technology and how this difference makes a difference in ethical
  considerations. In particular, I want to characterize computer ethics and show
  why this emerging field is both intellectually interesting and enormously
  important.</p>
<p>On my view, computer ethics is the analysis of the nature and social impact
  of computer technology and the corresponding formulation and justification of
  policies for the ethical use of such technology. I use the phrase "computer
  technology" because I take the subject matter of the field broadly to include
  computers and associated technology. For instance, I include concerns about
  software as well as hardware and concerns about networks connecting computers
  as well as computers themselves.</p>
<p>A typical problem in computer ethics arises because there is a <strong>policy
    vacuum</strong> about how computer technology should be used. Computers
  provide us with new capabilities and these in turn give us new choices for
  action. Often, either no policies for conduct in these situations exist or
  existing policies seem inadequate. A central task of computer ethics is to
  determine what we should do in such cases, i.e., to formulate policies to
  guide our actions. Of course, some ethical situations confront us as
  individuals and some as a society. Computer ethics includes consideration of
  both personal and social policies for the ethical use of computer technology.
</p>
<p>Now it may seem that all that needs to be done is the mechanical application
  of an ethical theory to generate the appropriate policy. But this is usually
  not possible. A difficulty is that along with a policy vacuum there is often a
  <strong>conceptual vacuum</strong>. Although a problem in computer ethics may
  seem clear initially, a little reflection reveals a <strong>conceptual
    muddle</strong>. What is needed in such cases is an analysis which provides
  a coherent conceptual framework within which to formulate a policy for action.
  Indeed, much of the important work in computer ethics is devoted to proposing
  conceptual frameworks for understanding ethical problems involving computer
  technology.</p>
<p>An example may help to clarify the kind of conceptual work that is required.
  Let's suppose we are trying to formulate a policy for protecting computer
  programs. Initially, the idea may seem clear enough. We are looking for a
  policy for protecting a kind of intellectual property. But then a number of
  questions which do not have obvious answers emerge. What is a computer
  program? Is it really intellectual property which can be owned or is it more
  like an idea, an algorithm, which is not owned by anybody? If a computer
  program is intellectual property, is it an expression of an idea that is owned
  (traditionally protectable by copyright) or is it a process that is owned
  (traditionally protectable by patent)? Is a machine-readable program a copy of
  a human-readable program? Clearly, we need a conceptualization of the nature
  of a computer program in order to answer these kinds of questions. Moreover,
  these questions must be answered in order to formulate a useful policy for
  protecting computer programs. Notice that the conceptualization we pick will
  not only affect how a policy will be applied but to a certain extent what the
  facts are. For instance, in this case the conceptualization will determine
  when programs count as instances of the same program.</p>
<p>Even within a coherent conceptual framework, the formulation of a policy for
  using computer technology can be difficult. As we consider different policies
  we discover something about what we value and what we don't. Because computer
  technology provides us with new possibilities for acting, new values emerge.
  For example, creating software has value in our culture which it didn't have a
  few decades ago. And old values have to be reconsidered. For instance,
  assuming software is intellectual property, why should intellectual property
  be protected? In general, the consideration of alternative policies forces us
  to discover and make explicit what our value preferences are.</p>
<p>The mark of a basic problem in computer ethics is one in which computer
  technology is essentially involved and there is an uncertainty about what to
  do and even about how to understand the situation. Hence, not all ethical
  situations involving computers are central to computer ethics. If a burglar
  steals available office equipment including computers, then the burglar has
  done something legally and ethically wrong. But this is really an issue for
  general law and ethics. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Computers
    are only accidently involved in this situation, and there is no policy or
    conceptual vacuum to fill</span>. The situation and the applicable policy
  are clear.</p>
<p>In one sense I am arguing for the special status of computer ethics as a
  field of study. Applied ethics is not simply ethics applied. But, I also wish
  to stress the underlying importance of general ethics and science to computer
  ethics. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ethical theory provides
    categories and procedures for determining what is ethically relevant</span>.
  For example, what kinds of things are good? What are our basic rights? What is
  an impartial point of view? These considerations are essential in comparing
  and justifying policies for ethical conduct. Similarly, <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">scientific information is crucial in
    ethical evaluations</span>. It is amazing how many times ethical disputes
  turn not on disagreements about values but on disagreements about facts.</p>
<p>On my view, computer ethics is a dynamic and complex field of study which
  considers the relationships among facts, conceptualizations, policies and
  values with regard to constantly changing computer technology. Computer ethics
  is not a fixed set of rules which one shellacs and hangs on the wall. Nor is
  computer ethics the rote application of ethical principles to a value-free
  technology. Computer ethics requires us to think anew about the nature of
  computer technology and our values. Although computer ethics is a field
  between science and ethics and depends on them, <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">it is also a discipline in its own right
    which provides both conceptualizations for understanding and policies for
    using computer technology</span>.</p>
<p>Though I have indicated some of the intellectually interesting features of
  computer ethics, I have not said much about the problems of the field or about
  its practical importance. The only example I have used so far is the issue of
  protecting computer programs which may seem to be a very narrow concern. In
  fact, I believe the domain of computer ethics is quite large and extends to
  issues which affect all of us. Now I want to turn to a consideration of these
  issues and argue for the practical importance of computer ethics. I will
  proceed not by giving a list of problems but rather by analyzing the
  conditions and forces which generate ethical issues about computer technology.
  In particular, I want to analyze what is special about computers, what social
  impact computers will have, and what is operationally suspect about computing
  technology. I hope to show something of the nature of computer ethics by doing
  some computer ethics.</p>
<h3>THE REVOLUTIONARY MACHINE</h3>
<p>What is special about computers? It is often said that a Computer Revolution
  is taking place, but what is it about computers that makes them revolutionary?
  One difficulty in assessing the revolutionary nature of computers is that the
  word "revolutionary" has been devalued. Even minor technological improvements
  are heralded as revolutionary. A manufacturer of a new dripless pouring spout
  may well promote it as revolutionary. If minor technological improvements are
  revolutionary, then undoubtedly everchanging computer technology is
  revolutionary. The interesting issue, of course, is whether there is some
  nontrivial sense in which computers are revolutionary. What makes computer
  technology importantly different from other technology? Is there any real
  basis for comparing the Computer Revolution with the Industrial Revolution?
</p>
<p>If we look around for features that make computers revolutionary, several
  features suggest themselves. For example, in our society computers are
  affordable and abundant. It is not much of an exaggeration to say that
  currently in our society every major business, factory, school, bank, and
  hospital is rushing to utilize computer technology. Millions of personal
  computers are being sold for home use. Moreover, computers are integral parts
  of products which don't look much like computers such as watches and
  automobiles. Computers are abundant and inexpensive, but so are pencils. Mere
  abundance and affordability don't seem sufficient to justify any claim to
  technological revolution.</p>
<p>One might claim the newness of computers makes them revolutionary. Such a
  thesis requires qualification. Electronic digital computers have been around
  for forty years. In fact, if the abacus counts as a computer, then computer
  technology is among the oldest technologies. A better way to state this claim
  is that recent engineering advances in computers make them revolutionary.
  Obviously, computers have been immensely improved over the last forty years.
  Along with dramatic increases in computer speed and memory there have been
  dramatic decreases in computer size. Computer manufacturers are quick to point
  out that desk top computers today exceed the engineering specifications of
  computers which filled rooms only a few decades ago. There has been also a
  determined effort by companies to make computer hardware and computer software
  easier to use. Computers may not be completely user friendly but at least they
  are much less unfriendly. However, as important as these features are, they
  don't seem to get to the heart of the Computer Revolution. Small, fast,
  powerful and easy-to-use electric can openers are great improvements over
  earlier can openers, but they aren't in the relevant sense revolutionary.</p>
<p>Of course, it is important that computers are abundant, less expensive,
  smaller, faster, and more powerful and friendly. But, these features serve as
  enabling conditions for the spread of the Computer Revolution. The essence of
  the Computer Revolution is found in the nature of a computer itself. What is
  revolutionary about computers is <strong>logical malleability</strong>. <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">Computers are logically malleable in
    that they can be shaped and molded to do any activity that can be
    characterized in terms of inputs, outputs, and connecting logical
    operations</span>. Logical operations are the precisely defined steps which
  take a computer from one state to the next. The logic of computers can be
  massaged and shaped in endless ways through changes in hardware and software.
  Just as the power of a steam engine was a raw resource of the Industrial
  Revolution so the logic of a computer is a raw resource of the Computer
  Revolution. Because logic applies everywhere, <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">the potential applications of computer
    technology appear limitless</span>. The computer is the nearest thing we
  have to a universal tool. Indeed, the limits of computers are largely the
  limits of our own creativity. The driving question of the Computer Revolution
  is "How can we mold the logic of computers to better serve our purposes?"</p>
<p>I think logical malleability explains the already widespread application of
  computers and hints at the enormous impact computers are destined to have.
  Understanding the logical malleability of computers is essential to
  understanding the power of the developing technological revolution.
  Understanding logical malleability is also important in setting policies for
  the use of computers. Other ways of conceiving computers serve less well as a
  basis for formulating and justifying policies for action.</p>
<p>Consider an alternative and popular conception of computers in which
  computers are understood as number crunchers, i.e., essentially as numerical
  devices. On this conception computers are nothing but big calculators. It
  might be maintained on this view that mathematical and scientific applications
  should take precedence over nonnumerical applications such as word processing.
  My position, on the contrary, is that computers are logically malleable. The
  arithmetic interpretation is certainly a correct one, but it is only one among
  many interpretations. Logical malleability has both a syntactic and a semantic
  dimension. Syntactically, the logic of computers is malleable in terms of the
  number and variety of possible states and operations. Semantically, the logic
  of computers is malleable in that the states of the computer can be taken to
  represent anything. Computers manipulate symbols but they don't care what the
  symbols represent. Thus, there is no ontological basis for giving preference
  to numerical applications over nonnumerical applications.</p>
<p>The fact that computers can be described in mathematical language, even at a
  very low level, doesn't make them essentially numerical. For example, machine
  language is conveniently and traditionally expressed in 0's and l's. But the
  0's and l's simply designate different physical states. We could label these
  states as "on" and "off" or "yin" and "yang" and apply binary logic.
  Obviously, at some levels it is useful to use mathematical notation to
  describe computer operations, and it is reasonable to use it. <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">The mistake is to reify the mathematical
    notation as the essence of a computer and then use this conception to make
    judgments about the appropriate use of computers</span>.</p>
<p>In general, our conceptions of computer technology will affect our policies
  for using it. I believe the importance of properly conceiving the nature and
  impact of computer technology will increase as the Computer Revolution
  unfolds.</p>
<h3>ANATOMY OF THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION</h3>
<p>Because the Computer Revolution is in progress, it is difficult to get a
  perspective on its development. By looking at the Industrial Revolution I
  believe we can get some insight into the nature of a technological revolution.
  Roughly, the Industrial Revolution in England occurred in two major stages.
  The first stage was the technological introduction stage which took place
  during the last half of the Eighteenth Century. During this stage inventions
  and processes were introduced, tested, and improved. There was an
  industrialization of limited segments of the economy, particularly in
  agriculture and textiles. The second stage was the technological permeation
  stage which took place during the Nineteenth Century. As factory work
  increased and the populations of cities swelled, not only did well known
  social evils emerge, but equally significantly corresponding changes in human
  activities and institutions, ranging from labor unions to health services,
  occurred. The forces of industrialization dramatically transformed the
  society.</p>
<p>My conjecture is that the Computer Revolution will follow a similar two stage
  development. The first stage, the introduction stage, has been occurring
  during the last forty years. Electronic computers have been created and
  refined. We are gradually entering the second stage, the <strong>permeation
    stage</strong>, in which computer technology will become an integral part of
  institutions throughout our society. <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">I think that in the coming decades many
    human activities and social institutions will be transformed by computer
    technology and that this transforming effect of computerization will raise a
    wide range of issues for computer ethics</span>.</p>
<p>What I mean by "transformed" is that the basic nature or purpose of an
  activity or institution is changed. This is marked by the kinds of questions
  that are asked. During the introduction stage computers are understood as
  tools for doing standard jobs. A typical question for this stage is "How well
  does a computer do such and such an activity?" Later, during the permeation
  stage, computers become an integral part of the activity. A typical question
  for this stage is "What is the nature and value of such and such an activity?"
  In our society there is already some evidence of the transforming effect of
  computerization as marked by the kind of questions being asked.</p>
<p>For example, for years computers have been used to count votes. Now the
  election process is becoming highly computerized. Computers can be used to
  count votes and to make projections about the outcome. Television networks use
  computers both to determine quickly who is winning and to display the results
  in a technologically impressive manner. During the last presidential election
  in the United States [1984] the television networks projected the results not
  only before the polls in California were closed but also before the polls in
  New York were closed. In fact, voting was still going on in over half the
  states when the winner was announced. The question is no longer "How
  efficiently do computers count votes in a fair election?" but "What is a fair
  election?" Is it appropriate that some people know the outcome before they
  vote? The problem is that computers not only tabulate the votes for each
  candidate but likely influence the number and distribution of these votes. For
  better or worse, our electoral process is being transformed.</p>
<p>As computers permeate more and more of our society, I think we will see more
  and more of the transforming effect of computers on our basic institutions and
  practices. Nobody can know for sure how our computerized society will look
  fifty years from now, but it is reasonable to think that various aspects of
  our daily work will be transformed. Computers have been used for years by
  businesses to expedite routine work, such as calculating payrolls; but as
  personal computers become widespread and allow executives to work at home, and
  as robots do more and more factory work, the emerging question will be not
  merely "How well do computers help us work?" but "What is the nature of this
  work?"</p>
<p>Traditional work may no longer be defined as something that normally happens
  at a specific time or a specific place. Work for us may become less doing a
  job than instructing a computer to do a job. As the concept of work begins to
  change, the values associated with the old concept will have to be reexamined.
  Executives who work at a computer terminal at home will lose some spontaneous
  interaction with colleagues. Factory workers who direct robots by pressing
  buttons may take less pride in a finished product. And similar effects can be
  expected in other types of work. Commercial pilots who watch computers fly
  their planes may find their jobs to be different from what they expected.</p>
<p>A further example of the transforming effect of computer technology is found
  in financial institutions. As the transfer and storage of funds becomes
  increasingly computerized the question will be not merely "How well do
  computers count money?" but "What is money?" For instance, in a cashless
  society in which debits are made to one's account electronically at the point
  of sale, has money disappeared in favor of computer records or have electronic
  impulses become money? What opportunities and values are lost or gained when
  money becomes intangible?</p>
<p>Still another likely area for the transforming effect of computers is
  education. Currently, educational packages for computers are rather limited.
  Now it is quite proper to ask "How well do computers educate?" But as teachers
  and students exchange more and more information indirectly via computer
  networks and as computers take over more routine instructional activities, the
  question will inevitably switch to "What is education?" The values associated
  with the traditional way of educating will be challenged. How much human
  contact is necessary or desirable for learning? What is education when
  computers do the teaching?</p>
<p>The point of this futuristic discussion is to suggest the likely impact of
  computer technology. Though I don't know what the details will be, I believe
  the kind of transformation I am suggesting is likely to occur. This is all I
  need to support my argument for the practical importance of computer ethics.
  In brief, the argument is as follows: The revolutionary feature of computers
  is their logical malleability. Logical malleability assures the enormous
  application of computer technology. This will bring about the Computer
  Revolution. During the Computer Revolution many of our human activities and
  social institutions will be transformed. These transformations will leave us
  with policy and conceptual vacuums about how to use computer technology. Such
  policy and conceptual vacuums are the marks of basic problems within computer
  ethics. Therefore, computer ethics is a field of substantial practical
  importance.</p>
<p>I find this argument for the practical value of computer ethics convincing. I
  think it shows that computer ethics is likely to have increasing application
  in our society. This argument does rest on a vision of the Computer Revolution
  which not everyone may share. Therefore, I will turn to another argument for
  the practical importance of computer ethics which doesn't depend upon any
  particular view of the Computer Revolution. This argument rests on the
  invisibility factor and suggests a number of ethical issues confronting
  computer ethics now.</p>
<h3>THE INVISIBILITY FACTOR</h3>
<p>There is an important fact about computers. Most of the time and under most
  conditions computer operations are invisible. One may be quite knowledgeable
  about the inputs and outputs of a computer and only dimly aware of the
  internal processing. This invisibility factor often generates policy vacuums
  about how to use computer technology. Here I will mention three kinds of
  invisibility which can have ethical significance.</p>
<p>The most obvious kind of invisibility which has ethical significance is
  invisible abuse. <strong>Invisible abuse</strong> is the intentional use of
  the invisible operations of a computer to engage in unethical conduct. A
  classic example of this is the case of a programmer who realized he could
  steal excess interest from a bank. When interest on a bank account is
  calculated, there is often a fraction of a cent left over after rounding off.
  This programmer instructed a computer to deposit these fractions of a cent to
  his own account. Although this is an ordinary case of stealing, it is relevant
  to computer ethics in that computer technology is essentially involved and
  there is a question about what policy to institute in order to best detect and
  prevent such abuse. Without access to the program used for stealing the
  interest or to a sophisticated accounting program such an activity may easily
  go un-noticed.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Another possibility for invisible
    abuse is the invasion of the property and privacy of others</span>. A
  computer can be programmed to contact another computer over phone lines and
  surreptitiously remove or alter confidential information. Sometimes an
  inexpensive computer and a telephone hookup is all it takes. A group of
  teenagers, who named themselves "the 414s" after the Milwaukee telephone
  exchange, used their home computers to invade a New York hospital, a
  California bank, and a government nuclear weapons laboratory. These break-ins
  were done as pranks, but obviously such invasions can be done with malice and
  be difficult or impossible to detect.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">A particularly insidious example of
    invisible abuse is the use of computers for surveillance</span>. For
  instance, a company's central computer can monitor the work done on computer
  terminals far better and more discreetly than the most dedicated sweatshop
  manager. Also, computers can be programmed to monitor phone calls and
  electronic mail without giving any evidence of tampering. A Texas oil company,
  for example, was baffled why it was always outbid on leasing rights for
  Alaskan territory until it discovered another bidder was tapping its data
  transmission lines near its Alaskan computer terminal.</p>
<p>A second variety of the invisibility factor, which is more subtle and
  conceptually interesting than the first, is the presence of invisible
  programming values. <strong>Invisible programming values</strong> are those
  values which are embedded in a computer program.</p>
<p>Writing a computer program is like building a house. No matter how detailed
  the specifications may be, a builder must make numerous decisions about
  matters not specified in order to construct the house. Different houses are
  compatible with a given set of specifications. Similarly, <span
    style="text-decoration: underline;">a request for a computer program is made
    at a level of abstraction usually far removed from the details of the actual
    programming language</span>. In order to implement a program which satisfies
  the specifications a programmer makes some value judgments about what is
  important and what is not. These values become embedded in the final product
  and may be invisible to someone who runs the program.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, computerized airline reservations. Many different
  programs could be written to produce a reservation service. American Airlines
  once promoted such a service called "SABRE". This program had a bias for
  American Airline flights built in so that sometimes an American Airline flight
  was suggested by the computer even if it was not the best flight available.
  Indeed, Braniff Airlines, which went into bankruptcy for awhile, sued American
  Airlines on the grounds that this kind of bias in the reservation service
  contributed to its financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Although the general use of a biased reservation service is ethically
  suspicious, a programmer of such a service may or may not be engaged in
  invisible abuse. There may be a difference between how a programmer intends a
  program to be used and how it is actually used. Moreover, even if one sets out
  to create a program for a completely unbiased reservation service, some value
  judgments are latent in the program because some choices have to be made about
  how the program operates. Are airlines listed in alphabetical order? Is more
  than one listed at a time? Are flights just before the time requested listed?
  For what period after the time requested are flights listed? Some answers, at
  least implicitly, have to be given to these questions when the program is
  written. Whatever answers are chosen will build certain values into the
  program.</p>
<p>Sometimes invisible programming values are so invisible that even the
  programmers are unaware of them. Programs may have bugs or may be based on
  implicit assumptions which don't become obvious until there is a crisis. For
  example, the operators of the ill-fated Three Mile Island nuclear power plant
  were trained on a computer which was programmed to simulate possible
  malfunctions including malfunctions which were dependent on other
  malfunctions. But, as the Kemeny Commission which investigated the disaster
  discovered, the simulator was not programmed to generate simultaneous,
  independent malfunctions. In the actual failure at Three Mile Island the
  operators were faced with exactly this situation simultaneous, independent
  malfunctions. The inadequacy of the computer simulation was the result of a
  programming decision, as unconscious or implicit as that decision may have
  been. Shortly after the disaster the computer was reprogrammed to simulate
  situations like the one that did occur at Three Mile Island.</p>
<p>A third variety of the invisibility factor, which is perhaps the most
  disturbing, is <strong>invisible complex calculation</strong>. Computers today
  are capable of enormous calculations beyond human comprehension. Even if a
  program is understood, it does not follow that the calculations based on that
  program are understood. Computers today perform, and certainly supercomputers
  in the future will perform, calculations which are too complex for human
  inspection and understanding.</p>
<p>An interesting example of such complex calculation occurred in 1976 when a
  computer worked on the four color conjecture. The four color problem, a puzzle
  mathematicians have worked on for over a century is to show that a map can be
  colored with at most four colors so that no adjacent areas have the same
  color. Mathematicians at the University of Illinois broke the problem down
  into thousands of cases and programmed computers to consider them. After more
  than a thousand hours of computer time on various computers, the four color
  conjecture was proved correct. What is interesting about this mathematical
  proof, compared to traditional proofs, is that it is largely invisible. The
  general structure of the proof is known and found in the program and any
  particular part of the computer's activity can be examined, but practically
  speaking the calculations are too enormous for humans to examine them all.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The issue is how much we should
    trust a computer's invisible calculations. This becomes a significant
    ethical issue as the consequences grow in importance</span>. For instance,
  computers are used by the military in making decisions about launching nuclear
  weapons. On the one hand, computers are fallible and there may not be time to
  confirm their assessment of the situation. On the other hand, making decisions
  about launching nuclear weapons without using computers may be even more
  fallible and more dangerous. What should be our policy about trusting
  invisible calculations?</p>
<p>A partial solution to the invisibility problem may lie with computers
  themselves. One of the strengths of computers is the ability to locate hidden
  information and display it. Computers can make the invisible visible.
  Information which is lost in a sea of data can be clearly revealed with the
  proper computer analysis. But, that's the catch. We don't always know when,
  where, and how to direct the computer's attention. The invisibility factor
  presents us with a dilemma. We are happy in one sense that the operations of a
  computer are invisible. We don't want to inspect every computerized
  transaction or program every step for ourselves or watch every computer
  calculation. In terms of efficiency the invisibility factor is a blessing. But
  it is just this invisibility that makes us vulnerable. We are open to
  invisible abuse or invisible programming of inappropriate values or invisible
  miscalculation. The challenge for computer ethics is to formulate policies
  which will help us deal with this dilemma. We must decide when to trust
  computers and when not to trust them. This is another reason why computer
  ethics is so important.</p>
