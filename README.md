# COMP 301: Ethics and Technology

COMP 301 explores the ethical challenges posed by modern technology through a combination of theory, discussion, and hands-on experience. The course is organized around four main themes:

1. Introduction and Logical Arguments – Foundational concepts in ethical reasoning.


2. Privacy – Issues of personal data, surveillance, and consent.


3. Security and Crime – Cybersecurity, digital crime, and related ethical concerns.


4. Artificial Intelligence – Contemporary ethical debates surrounding AI technologies.



Each unit typically lasts three to four weeks (except the one-week introduction) and follows a structured workflow:

1. A demonstration of custom technology, providing a practical context for ethical analysis.


2. A short lecture on relevant theoretical frameworks.


3. Group work, where students analyze current articles and apply both the demo and theory to real-world scenarios.


4. A group assessment (10%) to review and reinforce understanding.



The course features a project worth 40% of the final grade, split between a presentation and a proposed artifact. This component encourages students to engage creatively with ethical issues, demonstrating both practical application and effective communication.

Students also complete peer-reviewed blog posts (10%) using CapU’s e-portfolio platform, alternating between writing and critique. This activity develops analytical skills and fosters engagement with contemporary ethical issues in technology.

Other assessments include a midterm exam (15%), and a final exam (20%), designed to reinforce understanding and evaluate students’ grasp of course material.

The primary textbook is Tavani’s Ethics and Technology (2016), which provides classic ethical theory. Students are encouraged to critically examine these ideas in light of current technological developments, exploring how modern tools and applications have shifted traditional ethical arguments.
